Sovereign Mobile Command Center

High-Performance State Architecture by LiveAdaptiv

The Sovereign Mobile Command Center is a lightweight, mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for elite professionals navigating high-acuity environments. It serves as the digital companion to the Alchemist's Deck and the Sovereign Architecture methodology.

🏛️ Project Philosophy

In the world of high-performance leadership (EY, RPC, Clinical Settings), "Stress Management" is a failure state. We focus on Stress Alchemy—the process of using biological friction as fuel for logical output. This app provides the hardware-level resets and software-level auditing required to maintain an "Architect State."
